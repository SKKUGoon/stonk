The Biden administration voted against a United Nations Security Council resolution that aimed to extend full member status to a Palestinian state Thursday. The final vote was 12 in favor, one against, with two countries — the United Kingdom and Switzerland — abstaining. If the resolution had been approved by the council, the issue would have then gone to the U.N. General Assembly, where two-thirds of the 193 member countries would have had to agree. Robert Wood, the alternate American representative to the United Nations, said after the vote that “the United States continues to strongly support a two state solution.”
